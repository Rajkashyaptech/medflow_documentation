# MedFlow – User Personas

## Overview

This document defines the **primary user personas** for the MedFlow system.  
User personas help us understand **who the users are**, **what problems they face**, and **how MedFlow solves those problems**.

For this project, we focus on **two core personas** to keep the scope small and realistic.
